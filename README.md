# Cafe Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a cafe to identify key trends, patterns, and insights. The goal is to understand what drives revenue and explore ways to improve operations and increase sales.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains 10,000 transaction records with the following columns:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Item**: Product purchased (e.g., Coffee, Cake, Juice).
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.
- **Price Per Unit**: Price of a single item.
- **Total Spent**: Total amount spent on the transaction.
- **Payment Method**: Payment method used (e.g., Credit Card, Cash).
- **Location**: Where the transaction took place (In-store or Takeaway).
- **Transaction Date**: Date and time of the transaction.

## Key Insights

1. **Revenue Distribution**:
   - The distribution of total revenue is analyzed, focusing on identifying anomalies and outliers.
   - Sales are fairly consistent, but there are some extreme values that likely correspond to special events or operational issues.

2. **Daily and Weekly Patterns**:
   - Revenue tends to be higher on certain weekdays (especially Tuesdays and Thursdays) and lower on Mondays, suggesting an opportunity for promotions or special offers to boost sales at the start of the week.

3. **Product Insights**:
   - Coffee accounts for the largest share of revenue, followed by juices, cakes, and cookies.
   - Understanding which products generate the most revenue can help in optimizing stock and marketing efforts.

4. **Payment Methods**:
   - The analysis of payment methods shows how different payment options contribute to overall revenue. This can guide the cafe in adjusting payment system offerings.

5. **Time-Based Analysis**:
   - Monthly revenue trends show stable sales, but there are some drops, particularly on Mondays. These could be linked to lower customer footfall at the start of the week.

6. **Anomalies**:
   - Anomalies in both total sales and transaction counts have been identified, pointing to days with unusually high or low performance. These should be examined for potential operational improvements.

## Recommendations

- **Promotions**: To boost sales at the start of the week, consider offering promotions or discounts.
- **Use Weekends for Premium Offers**: Capitalize on higher footfall during weekends by offering special deals or premium products.
- **Monitor Anomalous Days**: Keep an eye on days with extreme sales variations to address any operational issues or capitalize on unexpected opportunities.

This analysis provides a roadmap for enhancing cafe operations and increasing revenue by focusing on the most popular products, addressing low-sales days, and exploring seasonal patterns.
